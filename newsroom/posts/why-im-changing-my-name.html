        </div>
        <div class="main-content">
            <h1>
                <span>ðŸ§‘</span> The name change
              </h1>
            <p>
                One thing ive been asked a lot lately is why im changing my name.
                And with this comes a few main reasons.
                <br></br>
                <b>Reason 1:</b> I dont like the name Owen, and internally I never
                really have. I just never thought it fits my personality (or at
                least my internal perception of my external personality).
                <br></br>
                <b>Reason B:</b> Id like a more gender neutral name. Over the
                years ive found i dont like to fit into any specific gender
                category. I just dont like finding myself in boxes of labels.
                Because of thsi I specifically chose a name thats hard to identify
                the gender of. Part of this is also the initial perception of a
                person in settings such as interviews or first meetings, I dont
                want anyone to be able to tell who I am before I talk to them
                (gender, sexuality, and race wise)
                <br></br>
                <b>Reason III:</b> I want to change it, because its my flessh
                vessel and I should feel comfortable in it. I only get one life,
                so I might as well make it count for something. Taking what you
                have been given has never been my real agenda, ive always gone out
                of my way to make a path for myself. So thats exactly what im
                doing here
                <br></br>
                <b>So what does this mean?</b>
                <p>
                  This means that everything is going to be changng soon. First,
                  im starting with changing my domain name to
                  <code>quinn.cx</code>. But thats only the begining, eventually I
                  plan to fully change over to using my new name and I want to be
                  called by it. Starting out ive only told the people im close to,
                  but as ive made this a public post now I suppose people are
                  going to find it. And im just telling myself thats okay. If you
                  have dug around my website and have read this, congrats, you now
                  know what to call me. However, for this same reason that ive not
                  told anyone, im also keeping my old <code>rummage.cc</code>
                  domain up and pointing to this site.
                  
                  Regardless though, this is happening, im finally comfortable
                  with it and its how its going to be.
                  <br></br>
                  Thank you for reading,
                  <br></br>
